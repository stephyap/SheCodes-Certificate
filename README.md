# SheCodes-Certificate
includes final project (React.js) code file from my front-end web development bootcamp with SheCodes.io. 

Reason behind the Bootcamp:
This summer, I had the urge to want to learn how to be able to design my own website/portfolio.
Therefore, I signed myself up for a frontend web development bootcamp that includes Javascript and React.js with Shecodes.io. 
I absolutely enjoyed it and I'm currently in the process of refining my portfolio.
